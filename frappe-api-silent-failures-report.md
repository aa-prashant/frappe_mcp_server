# Frappe API Silent Failures Report

## Issue Description

We've encountered a critical issue with the Frappe API where document creation operations (specifically for the Note doctype) return success responses but fail to actually create documents. This "silent failure" pattern makes it extremely difficult to diagnose issues and leads to data integrity problems in applications that rely on these API calls.

## Environment Details

- Frappe Version: [Your Frappe Version]
- Authentication Method: API Key/Secret
- User: Highly privileged account (Administrator impersonation)

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Authenticate using API Key/Secret
2. Attempt to create a Note document using the API
3. Receive a success response
4. Verify that no document was actually created

## Investigation Steps and Findings

### 1. Verified Authentication

```
Method: frappe.auth.get_logged_user
Response: "geveritt@appliedrelevance.com"
```

This confirmed we were properly authenticated with a highly privileged account.

### 2. Verified API Connection

```
Method: ping
Response: {"message": "pong"}
```

This confirmed the basic API functionality was working.

### 3. Attempted to Create a Note Document

```
Method: create_document
Arguments:
{
  "doctype": "Note",
  "values": {
    "title": "Star Trek: The Next Generation",
    "content": "Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise..."
  }
}
Response: "Document created successfully using token authentication: []"
```

The API returned a success response but with an empty array (no document ID).

### 4. Verified Note Was Not Created

```
Method: list_documents
Arguments:
{
  "doctype": "Note",
  "fields": ["name", "title", "content", "creation", "modified"]
}
Response: []
```

No Note documents were found, confirming the document was not actually created despite the success response.

### 5. Tried with a Unique Title for Easy Searching

```
Method: create_document
Arguments:
{
  "doctype": "Note",
  "values": {
    "title": "UNIQUE_TEST_NOTE_20250318",
    "content": "This is a unique test note created on March 18, 2025..."
  }
}
Response: "Document created successfully using token authentication: []"
```

Again, received a success response but no document ID.

### 6. Searched for the Unique Title

```
Method: list_documents
Arguments:
{
  "doctype": "Note",
  "filters": {
    "title": "UNIQUE_TEST_NOTE_20250318"
  },
  "fields": ["name", "title", "content", "creation", "modified"]
}
Response: []
```

Confirmed the document with the unique title was not created.

### 7. Tried with a Different DocType (ToDo)

```
Method: create_document
Arguments:
{
  "doctype": "ToDo",
  "values": {
    "description": "Test ToDo from MCP Server",
    "status": "Open",
    "priority": "Medium"
  }
}
Response: "Document created successfully using token authentication: [{"name": "04284ace04"}, {"name": "2a04d50cfb"}, ...]"
```

Interestingly, this returned a list of existing ToDo document IDs rather than creating a new one.

### 8. Verified ToDo Documents

```
Method: get_document
Arguments:
{
  "doctype": "ToDo",
  "name": "04284ace04"
}
Response: {
  "name": "04284ace04",
  "owner": "Administrator",
  "creation": "2024-02-19 12:12:00.871077",
  ...
  "description": "Assignment for File f8c6f3b49f",
  ...
}
```

This confirmed that the returned IDs were for existing documents, not newly created ones.

### 9. Checked Note DocType Schema

```
Method: get_doctype_schema
Arguments:
{
  "doctype": "Note"
}
Response: {
  "name": "Note",
  "module": "Desk",
  "isSingle": false,
  "isTable": false,
  "isCustom": false,
  "autoname": "hash",
  "fieldCount": 8,
  "fieldTypes": {
    "Data": 1,
    "Check": 3,
    "Date": 1,
    "Text Editor": 1,
    "Section Break": 1,
    "Table": 1
  },
  "requiredFields": [],
  ...
}
```

The schema looks correct, with "title" being the only required field (which we were providing).

## Root Cause Analysis

This is a classic example of a "silent failure" pattern where the API returns success responses even when operations fail. The most likely causes are:

1. **Permission Issues**: Despite using a highly privileged account, there might be specific permission restrictions for Note creation.

2. **Verification Mechanism**: The client's verification mechanism is detecting that documents aren't being created, but this information isn't being properly propagated to the user.

3. **Server-Side Validation**: There might be server-side validation rules silently rejecting the document creation without returning proper error messages.

4. **API Implementation**: The Frappe API might be returning success before fully committing the document to the database.

## Impact

This issue has significant implications:

1. **Data Integrity**: Applications relying on these API calls may believe operations succeeded when they actually failed.

2. **Debugging Difficulty**: The lack of error messages makes it extremely difficult to diagnose and fix issues.

3. **User Experience**: End users may experience data loss or inconsistencies without clear error messages.

## Requested Support

We would appreciate assistance with:

1. Identifying why Note documents aren't being created despite success responses
2. Understanding why the API returns lists of existing documents instead of creating new ones
3. Recommendations for more robust error handling to prevent silent failures
4. Any configuration settings that might affect this behavior

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this critical issue.
